== SimplyInsured Work Sample

This is a small (incomplete) Rails app build during the SimplyInsured interview. Here's a reminder of what we worked on:

* `db/schema.rb` shows the database schema we worked up
* `app/models/plan.rb` shows the `calculate_price` function that takes in an array of `ages` and `zipcodes` to calculate the total price for a company

To see a Rails view displaying some sample calculations, spin up the Rails server and go to `localhost`. You'll see four sample calculations there.
