== SimplyInsured Work Sample

This is a small (incomplete) Rails app build during the SimplyInsured interview. Here's a reminder of what we worked on:

* `app/models/plan.rb` shows the `calculate_price` function that takes in an array of `ages` and `zipcodes` to calculate the total price for a company
